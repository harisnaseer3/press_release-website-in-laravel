                    <p>We may share your personal data with entities within the 500NewsWire group. Given that we are an international organization with our headquarters in the USA, this may involve transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Some of the third parties to whom we transfer your personal data are also based outside of the EEA, so their processing of your personal data will likewise involve a transfer outside the EEA. Where your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA we will ensure that we appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure the protection of your personal information, including the use of specific contracts approved by the European Commission giving your personal data the same protection as it has in Europe.  </p>
                    <p>Such transfers may be made by or to us in our capacity as a data processor or as a data controller:</p>

                    <p><b>Processor:</b> 500NewsWire is a provider of software, services and tools intended to help customers manage all aspects of their marketing and PR campaigns. 500NewsWire does not own or control any of the information it processes on behalf of its customer. All such information is owned and controlled by 500NewsWire’s customer. In this capacity, 500NewsWire receives information transferred from the EU to the US merely as a processor on behalf of its customer, although such information may not be required by 500NewsWire.</p>
                    <p><b>Data Controller:</b> 500NewsWire also provides information products designed to help customers research and plan their campaigns more effectively. In this function, 500NewsWire acts as a data controller of the personal information contained in these products and processes this personal information as a data controller.</p>

                <h5>Legal Basis for Processing</h5>
                <div class="about-prea">
                    <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
                    <p>Where we need to process your information to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</p>
                    <p>Where we need to process your information to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</p>
                    <p>Where it is in our legitimate interests to do so.  Our legitimate interests include our legitimate commercial interests in operating the 500NewsWire Services and providing you with access to our Media Database. We make sure that we consider and balance any potential negative impact on you and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.</p>
