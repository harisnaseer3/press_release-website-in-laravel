            <p class="sample-text">
                500NewsWire’s editorial staff reviews all press releases before distribution to ensure that content is newsworthy and in an acceptable press release format. Attention to the following guidelines will help your press release get speedy approval and distribution on our platform.
            </p>
            <p>500NewsWire press releases must contain a clear, timely and newsworthy angle and be free of advertising hype, direct address and spam. Press releases should incorporate the following features/qualities: </p>

            <br>
            <h5>Acceptable Content</h5>
            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>Common news angles include timely information about a new product or service, a business expansion or recent event, an organizational milestone like an anniversary or award or the issuance of a tip sheet or expert opinion on a topic currently in the news. The news announcement must be clearly stated in the headline.</p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <h5>Legal Press Release</h5>
            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>We require a case number, court of record, complaint number or other sufficient documentation for all press releases referencing legal action or criminal matters.</p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <h5>Contact Information</h5>
            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>500NewsWire press releases must contain a valid contact name, phone number, and e-mail address in the contact information.</p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <h5>PR Length</h5>
            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>Press releases should be between 400 and 900 words. The length of your release directly affects its distribution, and press releases that are overly short or long may have trouble being indexed in the search engines. The news Summary should also be limited to 1 or 2 sentences.</p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <h5>Grammar and Spelling</h5>
            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>Press releases should be free of spelling and grammatical errors, and should be written entirely in English. Although jargon and acronyms are commonplace in natural language, make sure to include definitions for industry jargon so the average person can understand as well.</p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <h5>Press Release Formatting </h5>
            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>Press releases cannot contain HTML tags and other formatting such as non-standard characters, tables or forced line breaks. Releases also should not be written partially or entirely in all capital letters. Before submitting your release, please ensure all links in your release are fully functional. If your website is not available or fully functional at the time of editorial review, you will need to remove the links from your release, or wait until the website is in operation to submit.</p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <h5>News Source</h5>
            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>500NewsWire requires a clear news source be identified in the headline. The news source is the company or organization that is issuing the release. If your agency, firm or business is distributing on behalf of a client, then the source would be the client’s company or organization’s name. It should also be clear how that company or organization relates to the news announcement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-prea">
                <p>If your press release is primarily aimed at selling a product or service, then it is an advertisement and not a press release. A good press release informs the media and the general public about a newsworthy topic. If the primary purpose of the document is to sell without any other newsworthy element, then it will be denied publication.</p>
